In Kubernetes, there are several types of services that can be used to expose applications running in a cluster. Here are the commonly used service types: 
 1. ClusterIP: This is the default service type. It exposes the service on an internal IP address that is reachable only within the cluster. 
 2. NodePort: This type exposes the service on a static port on each node in the cluster. It creates a ClusterIP service and a high-port (30000-32767) on each node, which forwards traffic to the ClusterIP. 
 3. LoadBalancer: This type provisions a load balancer in the cloud environment (e.g., AWS ELB or GCP Load Balancer) and assigns it a public IP address. It then routes traffic to the ClusterIP service. 
 4. ExternalName: This type maps the service to an external DNS name. It does not provide any proxying or load balancing and is used to connect to services outside the cluster.
